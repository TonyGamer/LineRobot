This is a basic program written in Arduino which makes a robot drive in a straight line, using a MPU6050 IMU for orientation, and a V1 motor/servo shield on an Arduino Uno.

##Building
1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Install the following libraries:
	1. [V1 Arduino Motor/Servo Shield Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library)
	2. [I2Cdev & MPU6050 Library](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib) (found in "i2cdevlib-master/Arduino")
3. Compile and build the program
